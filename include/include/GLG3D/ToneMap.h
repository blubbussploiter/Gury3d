/** 
  Applies gamma correction and bloom. 

  <b>GApp subclasses have a built-in ToneMap named GApp::toneMap.</b>

  In the real world, the shadow under a car is about 1,000,000 times darker than 
  the specular highlight off its hood.  Most computer displays can only represent
  a dynamic range of 255 values (eight bits) per color channel, so bright areas
  are blown out and all detail is lost in dark areas.  This is the dynamic range problem
  of displays.
  
  Furthermore, displays were 
  designed for 2D rendering where rgb=128 should <i>appear</i> half as bright as rgb=255.
  In contrast, 3D rendering simulates light, so rgb=128 should have half as much <i>energy</i>
  as rgb=255, which does not correspond to the perception of half as bright.  This is the
  gamma ramp problem.

  There are many sophisticated algorithms for altering a rendered image to correct both of these.
  This ToneMap class uses an algorithm that is not the most sophisticated, but is extremely
  fast and produces attractive results.  It alters the lights in a scene to conserve
  dynamic range and then post-processes an image to make overexposed areas "glow" and 
  correct the gamma ramp for all other areas.  The resulting images have more detail in dark areas
  and appear more realistic than unprocessed ones.

  Use Example:

  <PRE>
  void onGraphics(RenderDevice* rd) {
    LightingRef        lighting      = toneMap.prepareLighting(app->lighting);
    SkyParameters      skyParameters = toneMap.prepareSkyParameters(app->skyParameters);

    toneMap.beginFrame(rd);
        <i>rendering code ...</i>
    toneMap.endFrame(rd);
  }
  </PRE>
