 Allocate a VARArea, then allocate VARs within it.  VARAreas are garbage
 collected.  When no pointers remain to VARs inside it or the VARArea itself,
 it will automatically be reclaimed by the system.

 You cannot mix pointers from different VARAreas when rendering.  For
 example, if the vertex VAR is in one VARArea, the normal VAR and color
 VAR must come from the same area.


 You can't find out how much space is left for VARAreas in video memory,
 except by checking the VARArea::create value and seeing if it is NULL.

    /**
     These values are <B>hints</B>. Your program will work correctly
     regardless of which you use, but using the appropriate value
     lets the renderer optimize for your useage patterns and can
     increase performance.

     Use WRITE_EVERY_FRAME if you write <I>at least</I> once per frame
     (e.g. software animation).

     Use WRITE_EVERY_FEW_FRAMES if you write to the area as part of
     the rendering loop, but not every frame (e.g. impostors, deformable
     data).

     Use WRITE_ONCE if you do not write to the area inside the rendering
     loop (e.g. rigid bodies loaded once at the beginning of a game level).  
     This does not mean you can't write multiple times
     to the area, just that writing might be very slow compared to rendering.

     Correspond to OpenGL hints: 
      WRITE_ONCE : GL_STATIC_DRAW_ARB
      WRITE_EVERY_FRAME : GL_STREAM_DRAW_ARB
      WRITE_EVERY_FEW_FRAMEs : DYNAMIC_DRAW_ARB
