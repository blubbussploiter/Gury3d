 <H2>Discovery</H2>
 Discovery is the process by which computers on a Local Area Network (LAN) find
 one another.  The Discovery API allows clients to make a list of servers running
 the same application.  The application typically presents this list to the user
 so he can choose which server to connect to.
 <P>   
 Features of the Discovery API:
 <P>
 Low network traffic
 <BR>  - Broadcasts mainly occur only when a new machine enters/leaves the network
 <BR>Responsive
 <BR>  - Servers appear immediately after launching
 <BR>  - Servers disappear immedatiately after they shut down
 <BR>Extensible
 <BR>  - Add your own game information (e.g. score, num players, map name)
 <BR>Versioned
 <BR>  - Tracks incompatible servers so end-users know to upgrade their client/server

 <H2>Using the Discovery API</H2>

 Subclass DiscoveryAdvertisement to add fields describing a server running your
 application.  For a game, these might be the current map name and the number
 of players.
 <P>
 On the client, create an instance of DiscoveryClient<your advertisement subclass>.
 On the server, create an instance of DiscoveryServer and initialize it with an
 instance of your advertisement subclass.  From your main loop, call doNetwork()
 on the client and server instances.  When your server shuts down, invoke cleanup()
 on it.
