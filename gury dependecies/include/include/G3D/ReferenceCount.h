 Objects that are reference counted inherit from this.  Subclasses 
 <B>must</B> have a public destructor (the default destructor is fine)
 and <B>publicly</B> inherit ReferenceCountedObject.

 Multiple inheritance from a reference counted object is dangerous-- use 
 at your own risk.

 ReferenceCountedPointer and ReferenceCountedObject are threadsafe.
 You can create and drop references on multiple threads without
 violating integrity.  WeakReferenceCountedPointer is <i>not</i>
 threadsafe.  Introducing a weak pointer destroys all thread safety,
 even for strong pointers to the same object (this is inherent in the
 design of the class; we cannot fix it without slowing down the
 performance of reference counted objects.)

 <B>Usage Example</B>

  <PRE>

class Foo : public G3D::ReferenceCountedObject {
public:
    int x;
};

class Bar : public Foo {};

typedef G3D::ReferenceCountedPointer<Foo> FooRef;
typedef G3D::WeakReferenceCountedPointer<Foo> WeakFooRef;
typedef G3D::ReferenceCountedPointer<Bar> BarRef;


int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {

    WeakFooRef x;

    {
        FooRef a = new Foo();

        // Reference count == 1

        x = a;
        // Weak references do not increase count

        {
            FooRef b = a;
            // Reference count == 2
        }

        // Reference count == 1
    }
    // No more strong references; object automatically deleted.
    // x is set to NULL automatically.

    // Example of using dynamic cast on reference counted objects
    BarRef b = new Bar();

    // No cast needed to go down the heirarchy.
    FooRef f = b;

    // We can't cast the reference object because it is a class.
    // Instead we must extract the pointer and cast that:
    b = dynamic_cast<Bar*>(&*f);

    return 0;
}
